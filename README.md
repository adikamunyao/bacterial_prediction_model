# bacteria_prediction_model
a simple prediction model

## Problem
The general idea was that 60 patients were selected for sampling, clinical data collection, and high-throughput sequencing. The microbes were subjected to association degree analysis according to the results of high-throughput sequencing, bacteria fungi, bacteria archaea, bacteria virus, fungi Archaea, and so on.We then performed machine learning based on features from each group to build a special microbial early warning model.

We require association analysis and machine learning prediction models for the four species such as Bacteria fungi association degree analysis followed by machine learning with fungal, viral, bacterial, and archaeal data. With a little bit more of the algorithm. But it is best if there can be more than 4 algorithms.

### Steps
* Load the data
* Create training and test split
* Perform feature scaling
* Fit the model
* Measure the model performance
